# Piano and Shop App
This is a piano and shop app which i have built while i was learning about gridviews.I have watched a video about the implementation of gridviews and then thought of customizing it a bit to add somethings from my side.<br>
**About the app:**<br>
We have a Tabbar below the app bar in the initial home page of the screen. It has two screens there the user can navigate and find two unrelated things.<br>
The first part of the screen has 9 tiles which are made using the gridview which has a list to generate those tiles. These tiles then have a button inside them which on pressed will play a different sound for each of the button.<br>
The second part of the screen i.e. the shop screen has various different tiles(for now each tile has same widgets) which are also made with the help of gridview having a container in each of them.These can be used to sell somethings in-app and we can add muc more screen to it which wil be opening when "Buy now" will be clicked.
<br>
Things which are done in the app involves:
* MaterialApp class/design.
* Scaffold Class.
* AppBar.
* Use of functions and variables.
* Stateless and Stateful widget.
* Sound on button click
* List generater
* Gridview
* TabBar
___
Built using:
